just a real easy python based super mario odyessey online server manager
in order to have it auto run on pc boot pin the program to your start, then go to it in the windows start area, right click again, go to more and select open file location, then copy the shortcut of the server and select the folder named startup, and paste the chortcut in there, the app should now be in ur startup apps in settings and enabled by default
create a folder and put your server, your server settings, and the supervisor program into it and name it what you want, the reason is because the supervisor looks for the server locally in the folder its in
the server must be named mysmooserver and must be a exe file format, as this is what the supervisor is looking for
